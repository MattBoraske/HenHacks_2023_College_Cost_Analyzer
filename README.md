# HenHacks 2023 - College Cost Analyzer
Team HackToTheFuture's repository for HenHacks 2023 Hackathon.

This project was created as a submission for the [Improving Access to Information for the Underserved Hack](https://www.henhackshackathon.com/hack-categories).

This tool, called the College Cost Analyzer, provides a Return-On-Investment (ROI) analysis for the completion of a bachelor's degree in a given major at a United States college. 
Simply enter the school and major to get a bar chart that compares the average cost of attendance for 4 years with the average salary for graduates of that major
as well as a table that shows how many years it will take to pay off the cost of attendance depending on the percentage of salary set aside.

Data was sourced from the [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/) using their API.
